Generate a comprehensive ROADMAP.md file for this project.

## Context

Based on the project analysis, create a milestone-based roadmap that guides development from current state to a mature, production-ready application.

## Format Requirements

Use GitHub-flavored markdown with checkbox syntax:

```markdown
# Roadmap

> Last updated: [Current Date]

## Overview

[1-2 sentences describing the roadmap strategy]

## Milestone 1: [Descriptive Name]

**Goal**: [Clear, measurable objective for this milestone]

**Priority**: P0 (Critical path)

### Tasks

- [ ] Task description (specific and actionable)
- [ ] Another task
- [ ] ...

**Success Criteria**:
- [How do we know this milestone is complete?]

## Milestone 2: [Name]

**Goal**: [Objective]

**Priority**: P1

### Tasks

- [ ] ...

[Continue for 3-6 milestones total]
```

## Content Guidelines

1. **Be Specific**: Tasks should be concrete, not vague
   - ✅ "Implement user authentication with JWT tokens"
   - ❌ "Add auth"

2. **Right-size Tasks**: Each task should take 1-4 hours
   - If larger, break into sub-tasks

3. **Logical Sequencing**: Order milestones by dependency
   - Foundation → Core Features → Polish → Launch

4. **Context-Aware**:
   - For NEW projects: Focus on scaffolding, architecture, MVP features
   - For EXISTING projects: Focus on improvements, missing features, technical debt
   - For MATURE projects: Focus on optimization, new features, scaling

5. **Include Quality Gates**:
   - Testing requirements
   - Documentation requirements
   - Code review checkpoints

## Milestone Themes (adapt to project needs)

### For New Projects:
1. Foundation & Setup
2. Core Architecture
3. MVP Features
4. Testing & Documentation
5. Launch Preparation

### For Existing Projects:
1. Audit & Assessment
2. Technical Debt Cleanup
3. Feature Enhancements
4. Performance & Optimization
5. Production Readiness

## Output

Create the roadmap file at: `.claude/planning/ROADMAP.md`

Make it actionable - this is what guides all future development work.
