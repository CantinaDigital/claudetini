Generate comprehensive architecture documentation for this project.

## Purpose

The ARCHITECTURE.md file explains the high-level design, component relationships, and key architectural decisions. It helps new developers (and AI assistants) quickly understand how the system works.

## Target Audience

- New developers joining the project
- Claude Code when making architectural changes
- Future maintainers reviewing design decisions

## Required Sections

### 1. Overview

```markdown
# Architecture

> Last updated: [Date]

## Overview

[2-3 paragraphs explaining the system at a high level]

**Key Goals:**
- [Primary architectural goal 1]
- [Primary architectural goal 2]
- [Primary architectural goal 3]
```

### 2. System Architecture

```markdown
## System Architecture

[Describe the overall system design. Use diagrams!]

### Architecture Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Component A] --> B[Component B]
    B --> C[Component C]
    C --> D[External Service]
```

### Components

#### Component Name
- **Purpose**: [What does it do?]
- **Location**: [Where is the code?]
- **Key Responsibilities**: [Main functions]
- **Dependencies**: [What does it depend on?]

[Repeat for each major component]
```

### 3. Data Flow

```markdown
## Data Flow

[Explain how data moves through the system]

### Example Flow: [User Action]

1. User triggers [action]
2. Component A [processes]
3. Data flows to Component B via [mechanism]
4. Component B [performs operation]
5. Result returned to user

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    User->>ComponentA: Request
    ComponentA->>ComponentB: Process
    ComponentB->>Database: Store
    Database-->>ComponentB: Confirm
    ComponentB-->>User: Response
```
```

### 4. Key Design Decisions

```markdown
## Key Design Decisions

### Decision: [Title]

**Context**: [Why was this decision needed?]

**Options Considered**:
1. Option A: [Pros/Cons]
2. Option B: [Pros/Cons]

**Decision**: We chose [Option] because [reasoning]

**Consequences**: [Trade-offs we accepted]

[Repeat for each major architectural decision]
```

### 5. Technology Stack

```markdown
## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Language**: [e.g., Python 3.11+]
- **Framework**: [e.g., FastAPI, React, etc.]
- **Database**: [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB]
- **Deployment**: [e.g., Docker, AWS Lambda]

### Key Libraries
- Library 1: [Purpose]
- Library 2: [Purpose]

### Infrastructure
- [Cloud provider / hosting]
- [CI/CD tools]
- [Monitoring / observability]
```

### 6. Directory Structure

```markdown
## Directory Structure

```

**Key Directories:**
- `src/core/`: [Description]
- `src/api/`: [Description]
[Continue for important directories]
```

### 7. Deployment Architecture

```markdown
## Deployment Architecture

[Explain how the system is deployed in production]

### Environments
- **Development**: [How it runs locally]
- **Staging**: [Pre-production environment]
- **Production**: [Live environment]

### Deployment Process
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

### Infrastructure Diagram

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Load Balancer] --> B[App Server 1]
    A --> C[App Server 2]
    B --> D[(Database)]
    C --> D
```
```

### 8. Security & Performance Considerations

```markdown
## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: [How we handle auth]
- **Data Protection**: [Encryption, PII handling]
- **API Security**: [Rate limiting, validation]

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching Strategy**: [What we cache and why]
- **Scalability**: [How the system scales]
- **Bottlenecks**: [Known performance constraints]
```

### 9. Future Considerations

```markdown
## Future Considerations

### Planned Improvements
- [Architectural improvement 1]
- [Architectural improvement 2]

### Known Limitations
- [Limitation 1]: [Why it exists, when we'll address it]
- [Limitation 2]: [Why it exists, when we'll address it]

### Scalability Roadmap
- [How the architecture will evolve as system grows]
```

## Content Guidelines

1. **Use Diagrams**: Mermaid diagrams are highly effective
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Sequence diagrams
   - Data flow diagrams

2. **Be Honest**: Include limitations and trade-offs
   - What doesn't work well?
   - What would you change if starting over?
   - What are the known technical debt areas?

3. **Provide Context**: Explain WHY decisions were made
   - Not just "We use PostgreSQL"
   - But "We use PostgreSQL because we need ACID guarantees for financial transactions"

4. **Real Examples**: Reference actual code
   - Link to specific files
   - Show code snippets demonstrating patterns
   - Include real configuration examples

5. **Keep Updated**: Mark sections that change frequently
   - Date the document
   - Encourage updates when architecture changes
   - Note when sections are outdated

## Output

Create the file at: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

Make it comprehensive - this is the technical foundation for understanding the entire system.
