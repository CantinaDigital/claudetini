Generate a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file for this project.

## Purpose

CLAUDE.md provides instructions and context for Claude Code when working on this project. It should be:
- **Specific** to this project (not generic boilerplate)
- **Actionable** with concrete examples
- **Comprehensive** covering architecture, conventions, and commands
- **Maintained** as a living document

## Required Sections

### 1. Project Overview (2-3 paragraphs)

```markdown
# [Project Name]

> [One-line tagline describing what this project does]

## Project Overview

[Describe what this project does, who it's for, and why it exists.
Include the problem it solves and key value propositions.]

[Mention the tech stack and any unique architectural decisions.]
```

### 2. Architecture

```markdown
## Architecture

[High-level system design. Use diagrams where helpful.]

**Key Components:**
- Component A: [Responsibility]
- Component B: [Responsibility]

**Data Flow:**
[How data moves through the system]

**External Dependencies:**
- Dependency 1: [Purpose]
- Dependency 2: [Purpose]
```

### 3. Code Conventions

```markdown
## Code Conventions

### [Language] Specifics
- Naming: [snake_case, camelCase, PascalCase rules]
- File organization: [Where do different types of files go?]
- Import order: [How to order imports]

### Patterns & Practices
- [Key design patterns used]
- [Error handling approach]
- [State management approach (if applicable)]

### Example:
```[language]
// Show a concrete example of well-formatted code
```
```

### 4. Testing Strategy

```markdown
## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
[Command to run tests]
```

### Coverage Expectations
- Minimum coverage: [percentage]
- Critical paths must have: [unit/integration/e2e tests]

### Writing Tests
[Guidelines for writing tests, with example]
```

### 5. Development Workflow

```markdown
## Development Workflow

### Setup
```bash
# Clone and install
[Commands to get started]
```

### Common Commands
```bash
# Development server
[command]

# Build
[command]

# Lint
[command]

# Format
[command]
```

### Git Workflow
- Branch naming: [convention]
- Commit messages: [convention]
- PR requirements: [checklist]
```

### 6. Planning & Progress Tracking (IMPORTANT)

```markdown
## Planning & Progress Tracking

**Source of Truth:** `.claude/planning/ROADMAP.md`

- All tasks tracked in ROADMAP.md with checkbox format
- Mark items `[x]` when complete
- Add new tasks under appropriate milestones
- Keep managed section in sync with ROADMAP state

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT create stray planning documents (PLAN.md, TODO.md, etc.)
All planned work must be in the master roadmap.
```

## Content Guidelines

1. **Be Project-Specific**:
   - Reference actual files, directories, and patterns from THIS project
   - Include real examples from the codebase
   - Don't use placeholder text like "[Your API]"

2. **Show, Don't Tell**:
   - Include code snippets showing conventions
   - Provide actual command examples that work
   - Link to specific files as references

3. **Keep Updated**:
   - Include "Last updated" date
   - Encourage updates as project evolves
   - Mark sections that may change

4. **Consider the Audience**:
   - Written for Claude Code AND human developers
   - Explain WHY, not just WHAT
   - Include context for architectural decisions

## Output

Create the file at: `CLAUDE.md` (project root)

Make it useful - this is the first thing Claude Code reads when starting work.
